# CV Application

This app is meant to test me on how well I can use basic ReactJS tools and syntax. NOTE: After finishing this, I realized that I was supposed to be using states and props. Whoops. Guess I'll do that in the next app.

To run this app, you'll need to download the build repository and run it on a local server. As for the app itself, click the edit button in the top right of the screen to edit the info. Simple enough.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
