# CV Application

This app is meant to test me on how well I can use basic ReactJS tools and syntax.

To run this app, you'll need to download the build repository and run it on a local server. As for the app itself, click the edit button in the top right of the screen to edit the info. Simple enough.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
